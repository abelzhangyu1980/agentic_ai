The process of training AI models
AI designers and engineers develop AI models through a process called training. Here’s an example of the typical steps a designer might take in this process, in this case for building a model that predicts rainfall:

Define the problem to be solved. 
AI designers and engineers want to predict rain to help people stay dry when commuting to and from work. They start by considering AI’s capabilities and limitations before identifying an AI solution.

Collect relevant data to train the model. 
AI designers and engineers gather historical data of days when it rained and days when it didn't rain over the past 50 years.

Prepare the data for training. 
AI designers and engineers prepare the data by labeling important features, such as outdoor temperature, humidity, and air pressure, and then noting whether it rained. It's also common to separate the data into two distinct sets: a training set and a validation set to test with later.

Train the model. 
AI designers and engineers apply machine learning (ML) programs to the prepared training data. As the ML programs analyze the data, they begin learning how to recognize patterns that indicate the likelihood of rainfall, such as the combination of high temperatures, low air pressure, and high humidity.

Evaluate the model. 
AI designers and engineers use the validation set they prepared earlier to assess their model's ability to predict rainfall accurately and reliably. Analyzing a model's performance can uncover potential issues impacting the model, such as insufficient or biased training data. If any issues exist, the AI designers and engineers may revisit an earlier step in this process to try a different approach. Once the model performs well with its validation set, the process continues to the next step.

Deploy the model. 
When the AI designers and engineers are satisfied with their model's performance, they deploy it in an AI tool—helping people in their city stay dry on their way to work!
