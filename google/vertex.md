Vertex AI Agent Builder helps you turn your processes into multi-agent experiences by building on them, and not disrupting them–regardless of where you stand in your AI journey or which technology stack you've chosen.

Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents

Agents¶
In the Agent Development Kit (ADK), an Agent is a self-contained execution unit designed to act autonomously to achieve specific goals. Agents can perform tasks, interact with users, utilize external tools, and coordinate with other agents.

The foundation for all agents in ADK is the BaseAgent class. It serves as the fundamental blueprint. To create functional agents, you typically extend BaseAgent in one of three main ways, catering to different needs – from intelligent reasoning to structured process control.
